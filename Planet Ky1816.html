<h1 style="text-align:center;">Welcome to Planet Ky1816!</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    Planet Ky1816 or more commonly known as the 'Purple Planet' is located in the Proxima Galaxy,
    500 million lightyears away from Earth.
    The planet is completely purple in colour and filled with magical and mystical terrian. Planet Ky1816 is home to an advanced 
    extra terrestrial life form known as the 'Zotexs'. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Upon arriving on the Purple Planet, you are in awe by the breathtaking scenery. You have never seen anything like this. Amazed,
    you take a walk around the terrian. But little do you know that the Zotexs are a cautious and arrogant group of species.
    They have captured you and your spaceship. In order to defeat the Zotexs, you must complete two challenges, the Magical Forest and 
    the Magical Lake. First you must go through the Magical Forest and escape, after your escape the Magical Lake awaits you. Complete the 
    two challenges to defend the planet!
